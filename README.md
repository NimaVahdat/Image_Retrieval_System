# Image Retrieval System using VGG16, CBOW Word2Vec, and Projection Network
### Project Overview
This project presents an advanced image retrieval system that utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques. By combining the power of VGG16, CBOW Word2Vec, and a projection network, the system enables accurate retrieval of images from a vast collection based on textual descriptions.

### Key Features
Efficiently retrieves relevant images from a pile of 10,000 mixed images.
Seamlessly combines image and language embeddings for accurate matching.
Employs VGG16 as a feature extractor to obtain image embeddings.
Utilizes a pretrained CBOW Word2Vec model to generate language embeddings.
Integrates a projection network to align image embeddings with language embeddings.
Computes cosine similarity to determine the most relevant image based on the given description.
### How It Works
1. Image Embedding Extraction:
  - The VGG16 model is used to extract features from the images.
  - The final layer with a resolution of 7x7 provides rich image features.
  - By spatially averaging the 7x7 features, an embedding is obtained for each image.

2. Language Embedding Generation:
  - A pretrained CBOW Word2Vec model is employed to process textual descriptions.
  - The feature obtained after the averaging layer serves as the language embedding.

3. Projection Network:
  - A pre-implemented projection network is utilized to align image embeddings with language embeddings.
  - The network's weights are loaded to ensure accurate transformation.

4. Image Retrieval:
  - For each given description, the system follows these steps:
  - Computes the image embedding from the image using VGG16.
  - Generates the language embedding from the given description using CBOW Word2Vec.
  - Projects the image embedding from 512 dimensions to 300 dimensions using the projection network.
  - Computes the cosine similarity between the image embedding and the language embedding.
  - The image with the highest cosine similarity is considered the most matched image.

### Conclusion
The Image Retrieval System presented in this project showcases the integration of advanced deep learning models to accurately match images with textual descriptions. By leveraging the capabilities of VGG16, CBOW Word2Vec, and a projection network, the system offers a robust solution for the industry's image retrieval needs. The ability to efficiently retrieve relevant images from large collections based on textual descriptions has wide-ranging applications, from e-commerce to content management systems and beyond.
